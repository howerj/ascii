* Project: A VM with an ASCII based instruction set

This project is a work in progress. The idea is to make a Virtual Machine (VM) that
only uses printable ASCII characters as instructions, just for fun. It might be
possible depending on the choice of instructions to make a VM could in
principle be implemented in hardware on an FPGA.
